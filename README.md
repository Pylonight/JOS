JOS: Course Design of Operating System

I don not know why github could not trace my commitments since my last commitment on Mar. 21.
It is a birthday surprise, is it?
It seems that I got the wrong email? Try again.
Gmail doesn't work. Try to use other email. Need to be the primary email?

JOS will cost you a huge amount of time. But, not bad. You will have a better command of how a machine boot and how an os organize its memory resources, schedule user tasks and so on. Worth doing.
